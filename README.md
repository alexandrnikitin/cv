### About Me

I'm a Software Engineer at Adform focused on server-side, back-end and database development. I have extensive experience in creating scalable, distributed, fail-safe and high-load services. I'm passionate about high-performance systems and enjoy working on nontrivial tasks. I worked for enterprise, outsource, startup companies and as a freelancer for customers from various countries. I worked in Banking, Financial, Online advertising industries. I have strong background in C#/ .NET but enjoying Scala/ JVM for a couple of years already. Still... I do love .NET.



### Credo

* I do believe in the Engineering-driven culture. The culture where engineers decide what to do and how to do to achieve goals. This is the most efficient way to build high-quality software.  
* I do believe in the open-source model and [enjoy contributing to open-source projects.](https://github.com/alexandrnikitin/cv#open-source)  
* I do believe in fast feedback cycles in software development. `Pair programming -> Automated tests -> Code review -> Continuous Integration -> Continuous Deployment`, the development process is much more important than methodologies or management.  
* I do believe in automated tests [but don't abuse them.](https://alexandrnikitin.github.io/blog/a-single-purpose-of-automated-testing/)

I have several useful libraries and numerous contributions on github. [Take a look please.](https://github.com/alexandrnikitin)



### Public Fails

I write [a blog and enjoy doing it](https://alexandrnikitin.github.io/blog/).
I show up as a public speaker occasionally. I've spoken several times at internal (un)conferences and also at external meetups and conferences. You can find [some slides on github](https://github.com/alexandrnikitin/slides). There's even [a conference video publicly available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp4yQQqb2VI) if you want to take a look at me.

### Hobbies & Interests

Travelling, it gives the ability to see things, people, the world from different angles and be more objective.  
Cycling, I have a dream to travel around the world on [a bicycle](http://instagram.com/p/lCbB6mPpG7).  
Trekking, why do people climb [mountains](http://instagram.com/p/nQZoPRvpKr)?
